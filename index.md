I am a Mechanical Engineer from Brazil with a Master in Economics & Public Policy from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). 

In 2021, I was enrolled in a top 5 European Ph.D. in Economics but decided to leave and transition into **Data Science & Machine Learning**.

I grew up in Rio de Janeiro and education was the only weapon I had to succeed in
life. As a consequence, I was awarded by Yale University, University of California Los Angeles, General Electric Foundation, Lemann Foundation, and The Club of Rome.

I also bring business acumen and entrepreneurial skills to the table. In the past, I helped build a Brazilian FinTech Payments that filed for an IPO in 2018 (NASDAQ: STNE). It started with 3 employees and grew to over 5000. I was one of those 3 employees. I also worked as an education consultant where I was in charge of mapping processes at large private schools across Brazil. As a personal projects, I created MePrepara, a low-cost GRE / GMAT online math preparation course (140 math videos) for those who can't afford expensive prep courses. MePrepara has trained hundreds of people in Brazil who dream of studying in the best universities in the world.

What might differentiate me from others in the DS/ML industry is that I bring to the table a solid knowledge of Econometrics & Causal Inference, a good emotional intelligence and social skills, and a very diverse background.
