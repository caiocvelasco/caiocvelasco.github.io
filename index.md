I am a Mechanical Engineer from Brazil with a Master in Economics & Public Policy from the University of California Los Ansgeles (UCLA). In 2021, I was enrolled in a top 5 European Ph.D. in Economics in the Netherlands but decided to transition into
**Data Science & Machine Learning** :)

I grew up in Rio de Janeiro and education was the only weapon I had to succeed in
life. As a consequence, I was awarded by Yale University, UCLA, General Electric
Foundation, Lemann Foundation, and The Club of Rome.

What might differentiate me from others in the DS/ML industry is that I bring to the table a solid knowledge of Econometrics & Causal Inference.
