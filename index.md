I'm a Mechanical Engineer from Brazil with a Master in Economics & Public Policy from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). 

In 2021, because of the pandemic I decided to stop a Ph.D. in Economics in the Netherlands and start my transition into **the world of data**.

I grew up in Rio de Janeiro and education was the only weapon I had to succeed in life. As a consequence, I was awarded by Yale University, UCLA, General Electric Foundation, Lemann Foundation, and The Club of Rome.

I have a very technical profile, but I also bring strong business and entrepreneurial skills to the table. In the past, I helped build a Brazilian Payment FinTech that filed for an IPO in 2018 (NASDAQ: STNE). It started with 3 employees and grew to over 5000. I was one of those 3 employees. I also worked as an education consultant where I was in charge of mapping processes at large private schools across Brazil.

As hobbies, I play football competitively (forward). I have played in amateur leagues in Brazil, USA, and the Netherlands. This is largely due to my father's experience as a professional football player in Brazil. I also love to take long walks, to hike, travel to different places, and to maintain a healthy and organized routine. This is due to my mother's influence as a retired Colonel in the Brazilian Army and PhD in Education.

I find happiness in the little things in life and I learned a lot from every mistake I have made so far.

Thank you for visiting :)
