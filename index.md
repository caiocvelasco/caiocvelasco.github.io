I'm a Mechanical Engineer from Brazil with a Master in Economics & Public Policy from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) where I was awarded both the Lemann and the Luskin Fellowship for academic excellence. 

In 2021, because of the pandemic, I decided to stop a Ph.D. in Economics in the Netherlands and transition into **Data Science**.

I grew up in Rio de Janeiro and education was the only weapon I had to succeed in life. As a consequence of my efforts, I was awarded by Yale University, UCLA, General Electric Foundation, Lemann Foundation, and The Club of Rome.

I have a very technical profile, but I also bring strong business and entrepreneurial skills to the table. In the past, I helped build Stone Payments, a famous Brazilian FinTech payment company (NASDAQ: STNE). I also created my own mathematics digital product (MePrepara) with over 140 videos teaching low-income Brazilian students who want to take the GMAT and GRE exams and apply for MBA/PhD abroad. I also worked in the education sector in Brazil, as a consultant.

As hobbies, I play football competitively (forward), it's my passion. I have played in amateur leagues in Brazil, USA, and the Netherlands. I also have a strong passion for teaching and educating others. A personal characteristic I am proud of is the ability to transform very complex subjects into intuitive topics for any audience.

I find happiness in the little things in life and I also learned a lot from every mistake I have made so far (and still do).

Thank you for visiting :)

### Statistics & Data Science
I have a passion for teaching and I have been trained by amazing professors in top notch universities around the globe.

Therefore, I have started to write a book that belongs to a (future) course I call "**An Intuitive Course in Probability (and Statistics)**, _for data science_. The idea is to provide strong intuition for every major concept while keeping the mathematical formalization and rigor very close. I had this idea after taking a Probability Theory course from MIT. I am a fan. It will be available both in English and Portuguese.

Please, check the English version [here](https://caiocvelasco.github.io/assets/my_course/An_Intuitive_Course_in_Probability__draft_EN.pdf) and the Portuguese version [aqui!](https://caiocvelasco.github.io/assets/my_course/Um_Curso_Intuitivo_de_Probabilidade__draft_PT.pdf)

It's a working in progress, so you may find only part of Chapter 1 now.

### Math
Sometimes, I try to contribute to some interesting communities. You can check an example below.
