I am a Mechanical Engineer with a master in economics and public policy. In 2021, I
was enrolled in a top 5 European Ph.D. in Economics but decided to transition into
**Data Science & Machine Learning**.
I grew up in Rio de Janeiro and education was the only weapon I had to succeed in
life. As a consequence, I was awarded by Yale University, UCLA, General Electric
Foundation, Lemann Foundation, and The Club of Rome.
What might differentiate me from others in DS/ML is that I bring to the table a solid
knowledge of econometrics & causal inference.
